            Your lab tests will involve questions very similar to those in the sample question
            banks. Basically they&apos;ll change the numbers to make sure you think about how to
            solve the problem, rather than remember the letters, digits etc.

            What we have prepared are responses to sample questions generated from the question
            bank. You should always try to do the problems first yourself first. Should you get

            To get good marks, you should definitely not be relying on these solutions at all in the
