            These are solutions to sample lab tests created by MathSoc. Please let us know if you
            find any errors!
            <br />
            <br />
            Your lab tests will involve questions very similar to those in the sample question
            banks. Basically they&apos;ll change the numbers to make sure you think about how to
            solve the problem, rather than remember the letters, digits etc..
            <br />
            <br />
            What we have prepared are responses to sample questions generated from the question
            bank. You should always try to do the problems first yourself first. Should you get
            stuck, however, you can refer to our samples here to guide you back on the right track!
            <br />
            <br />
            To get good marks, you should definitely not be relying on these solutions at all in the
            end. You should have attempted the sample questions on MapleTA often enough to handle it
            all yourself!
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that these solutions are NOT endorsed by the UNSW School of Mathematics &
            Statistics, and that errors may exist. If you find answers that are incorrect, please
            send us a message, and weâ€™ll try to address the question as soon as possible.
