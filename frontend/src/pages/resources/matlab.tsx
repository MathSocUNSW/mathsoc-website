            Me, an intellectual: MATLAB.

            Hey friends, the slaves at MathSoc have created an Interactive MATLAB guide, which can
            be accessed here. It is meant to supplement the MATH1151/MATH1251 online modules, and
            contains 4 fun little projects to sink your teeth into. Note that it builds on, and does
            not replace, those modules which are excellent and comprehensive resources in itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            To access it, please export all given files into the same folder and double click on the
            one that says â€˜open thisâ€™. You: I want to learn a programming language.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions, suggestions or spot any
            mistakes! ðŸ™‚
