            Hey friends, the slaves at MathSoc have created an Interactive MATLAB guide, which can
            be accessed here. It is meant to supplement the MATH1151/MATH1251 online modules, and
            contains 4 fun little projects to sink your teeth into. Note that it builds on, and does
            not replace, those modules which are excellent and comprehensive resources in itself.
